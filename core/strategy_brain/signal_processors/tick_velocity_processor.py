"""
Tick Velocity Signal Processor
Measures how fast the Polymarket UP probability is moving in the
last 60 seconds before the trade window opens.

WHY THIS WORKS:
  If the "Up" probability moves from 0.50 → 0.57 in the last 45 seconds,
  BEFORE your bot even looks at it, that reflects real order flow from
  other traders reacting to BTC spot movement. The probability is being
  pushed by real money, and it often continues in the same direction
  for at least another 30–60 seconds.

  This is "price action" on the Polymarket itself — not a lagging
  external indicator. It's the most direct signal available.

HOW IT WORKS:
  The strategy stores a rolling tick buffer:
    self._tick_buffer = deque of {'ts': datetime, 'price': Decimal}

  This processor receives that buffer via metadata['tick_buffer'].

  It computes:
    1. 60s velocity  = (now_price - price_60s_ago) / price_60s_ago
    2. 30s velocity  = (now_price - price_30s_ago) / price_30s_ago
    3. Acceleration  = 30s_velocity - (60s_velocity - 30s_velocity)
                       (is it speeding up or slowing down?)

  Signal thresholds (for 0–1 probability prices):
    velocity > +1.5%  in 60s → BULLISH
    velocity < -1.5%  in 60s → BEARISH
    acceleration bonus: if move is accelerating → higher confidence

INTEGRATION:
  In bot.py on_quote_tick(), add:
    self._tick_buffer.append({'ts': now, 'price': mid_price})

  In _fetch_market_context(), add:
    metadata['tick_buffer'] = list(self._tick_buffer)
